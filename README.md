<h2>Automation Project</h2>

This is a first project I worked on in order to learn how to use Robot Framework.

The testing steps include: 
- opening the browser;
- navigating to a given website;
- validating that I'm on the right website;
- going to a specific section of the webpage (in this case "team");
- making sure I reached the right subsection;
- closing the browser;
